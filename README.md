Background
-----------
**About the company**: In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are
geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.


## Project Description
This project entails the analysis of bike trip data for two distinct member categories spanning a three-month period:

* Casual riders: those who have purchased full-day or single rides
* Annual members: individuals with annual memberships
  
**The objective of this project:**
  * gain insights into the usage patterns of Cyclistic bikes by casual riders and annual members.
  * devise an effective marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. 

**Dataset**: The analysis will cover bike data for April, May, and June of 2023.

It includes information on:
> bike ride id, station names, station id, starting time & date, ending time & date

**Limitation**: The recommendations were solely based on 3 months of data.

**To enhance our findings**:
 * Expanding the dataset to cover more months would provide a broader perspective
 * it would've further improved specificity if we had information on whether casual riders were using bikes for single rides or for full days
